The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
      
           syntax: file_object=open('filename','mode')


There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:

"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist


f = open("demofile.txt")   is same as  f = open("demofile.txt", "rt")



Read:
   f=open('filename','r')
      
syntax==>       f.read()   ==>By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return

for eg.         f.read(5) ==>Return the 5 first characters of the file


Readline: You can return one line by using the readline() method:

    f = open("demofile.txt", "r")

    print(f.readline())


By calling readline() two times, you can read the two first lines:

Read two lines of the file:

       f = open("demofile.txt", "r")

         print(f.readline())
         print(f.readline())

tell():
  this method is used to find current position of file pointer from beginning of the file. position start from 0.

  Syntax:   file_object.tell()

            takes no parameter

seek():
       This method is used to move file pointer from one position to another position from beginning of the file. Position start from 0 and it must be positive integer.
   Syntax:    file.object.seek(position)


With statement:

       The with statement can be used while opening a file.
       when we open a file using with statement there is no need to close the file explicitly.
       with statement in python is used in file exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable.

       Syntax:
              with open('filename','r')as file_object:
